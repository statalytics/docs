## Description

Session stats can be used to view stats since a certain point in time. The maximum concurrent sessions that can be tracked is 2 for free users, or 5 for [premium users](/premium/plans/).

Session stats are especially beneficial as they more accurately reflect a player's skill level. For this reason they are factored into the calculations of a range of different features, such as milestones, projected stats, and more.
