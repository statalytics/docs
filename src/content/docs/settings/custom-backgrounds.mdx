## Description

Custom backgrounds are a more flexible way of theming the images output by the bot. <a href="https://statalytics.net/premium" target="_blank">Statalytics Pro users</a> are able to upload custom background images from the [web dashboard](https://statalytics.net/dashboard).

Different images can be employed for different statistics when using custom backgrounds, which work on a per render basis.

:::note
To be viewable, custom backgrounds require your Discord account to be [linked to a player](/settings/linking/). This will allow other people to see your custom background images when they check your stats.
